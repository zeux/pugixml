1.07.2010 - v0.9
	Major release, featuring extended and improved Unicode support, miscellaneous performance improvements, bug fixes and more.

	Major Unicode improvements: 
		Introduced encoding support (automatic/manual encoding detection on load, manual encoding selection on save, conversion from/to UTF8, UTF16 LE/BE, UTF32 LE/BE) 
		Introduced wchar_t mode (you can set PUGIXML_WCHAR_MODE define to switch pugixml internal encoding from UTF8 to wchar_t; all functions are switched to their Unicode variants) 
		Load/save functions now support wide streams 

	Bug fixes: 
		Fixed document corruption on failed parsing bug 
		XPath string <-> number conversion improvements (increased precision, fixed crash for huge numbers) 
		Improved DOCTYPE parsing: now parser recognizes all well-formed DOCTYPE declarations 
		Fixed xml_attribute::as_uint() for large numbers (i.e. 2^32-1) 

	Specification changes: 
		parse() API changed to load_buffer/load_buffer_inplace/load_buffer_inplace_own; load_buffer APIs do not require zero-terminated strings. 
		Renamed as_utf16 to as_wide 
		Changed xml_node::offset_debug return type and xml_parse_result::offset type to ptrdiff_t 
		Nodes/attributes with empty names are now printed as :anonymous 

	Performance improvements: 
		Optimized document parsing and saving 
		Changed internal memory management: internal allocator is used for both metadata and name/value data; allocated pages are deleted if all allocations from them are deleted 
		Optimized memory consumption: sizeof(xml_node_struct) reduced from 40 bytes to 32 bytes on x86 
		Optimized debug mode parsing/saving by order of magnitude 

	Miscellaneous: 
		All STL includes except <exception> in pugixml.hpp are replaced with forward declarations 

	Compatibility: 
		parse() and as_utf16 are left for compatibility (these functions are deprecated and will be removed in pugixml-1.0) 
		Wildcard functions, document_order/precompute_document_order functions, format_write_bom_utf8 and parse_wnorm_attribute flags are deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0
		xpath_type_t enumeration was renamed to xpath_value_type

8.11.2009 - v0.5 
	Major bugfix release. Changes: 

	XPath bugfixes: 
		Fixed translate(), lang() and concat() functions (infinite loops/crashes) 
		Fixed compilation of queries with empty literal strings ("") 
		Fixed axis tests: they never add empty nodes/attributes to the resulting node set now 
		Fixed string-value evaluation for node-set (the result excluded some text descendants) 
		Fixed self:: axis (it behaved like ancestor-or-self::) 
		Fixed following:: and preceding:: axes (they included descendent and ancestor nodes, respectively) 
		Minor fix for namespace-uri() function (namespace declaration scope includes the parent element of namespace declaration attribute) 
		Some incorrect queries are no longer parsed now (i.e. foo: *) 
		Fixed text()/etc. node test parsing bug (i.e. foo[text()] failed to compile) 
		Fixed root step (/) - it now selects empty node set if query is evaluated on empty node 
		Fixed string to number conversion ("123 " converted to NaN, "123 .456" converted to 123.456 - now the results are 123 and NaN, respectively) 
		Node set copying now preserves sorted type; leads to better performance on some queries 

	Miscellaneous bugfixes: 
		Fixed xml_node::offset_debug for PI nodes 
		Added empty attribute checks to xml_node::remove_attribute 
		Fixed node_pi and node_declaration copying 
		Const-correctness fixes 

	Specification changes: 
		xpath_node::select_nodes() and related functions now throw exception if expression return type is not node set (instead of assertion) 
		xml_node::traverse() now sets depth to -1 for both begin() and end() callbacks (was 0 at begin() and -1 at end()) 
		In case of non-raw node printing a newline is output after PCDATA inside nodes if the PCDATA has siblings 
		UTF8 -> wchar_t conversion now considers 5-byte UTF8-like sequences as invalid 

	New features: 
		Added xpath_node_set::operator[] for index-based iteration 
		Added xpath_query::return_type() 
		Added getter accessors for memory-management functions 

17.09.2009 - v0.42 
	Maintenance release. Changes: 
		Fixed deallocation in case of custom allocation functions or if delete[] / free are incompatible 
		XPath parser fixed for incorrect queries (i.e. incorrect XPath queries should now always fail to compile) 
		Added PUGIXML_API/PUGIXML_CLASS/PUGIXML_FUNCTION configuration macros to control class/function attributes 
		Const-correctness fixes for find_child_by_attribute 
		Improved compatibility (miscellaneous warning fixes, fixed cstring include dependency for GCC) 
		Fixed iterator begin/end and print function to work correctly for empty nodes 
		Added xml_attribute::set_value overloads for different types 

8.02.2009 - v0.41 
	Maintenance release. Changes: 

		Fixed bug with node printing (occasionally some content was not written to output stream) 

18.01.2009 - v0.4 
	Changes: 

	Bugs: 
		Documentation fix in samples for parse() with manual lifetime control 
		Fixed document order sorting in XPath (it caused wrong order of nodes after xpath_node_set::sort and wrong results of some XPath queries) 

	Node printing changes: 
		Single quotes are no longer escaped when printing nodes 
		Symbols in second half of ASCII table are no longer escaped when printing nodes; because of this, format_utf8 flag is deleted as it's no longer needed and format_write_bom is renamed to format_write_bom_utf8. 
		Reworked node printing - now it works via xml_writer interface; implementations for FILE* and std::ostream are available. As a side-effect, xml_document::save_file now works without STL. 

	New features: 
		Added unsigned integer support for attributes (xml_attribute::as_uint, xml_attribute::operator=) 
		Now document declaration (<?xml ...?>) is parsed as node with type node_declaration when parse_declaration flag is specified (access to encoding/version is performed as if they were attributes, i.e. doc.child("xml").attribute("version").as_float()); corresponding flags for node printing were also added 
		Added support for custom memory management (see set_memory_management_functions for details) 
		Implemented node/attribute copying (see xml_node::insert_copy_* and xml_node::append_copy for details) 
		Added find_child_by_attribute and find_child_by_attribute_w to simplify parsing code in some cases (i.e. COLLADA files) 
		Added file offset information querying for debugging purposes (now you're able to determine exact location of any xml_node in parsed file, see xml_node::offset_debug for details) 
		Improved error handling for parsing - now load(), load_file() and parse() return xml_parse_result, which contains error code and last parsed offset; this does not break old interface as xml_parse_result can be implicitly casted to bool. 

31.10.2007 - v0.34 
	Maintenance release. Changes: 

		Improved compatibility (supported Digital Mars C++, MSVC 6, CodeWarrior 8, PGI C++, Comeau, supported PS3 and XBox360) 
		Fixed bug with loading from text-mode iostreams 
		Fixed leak when transfer_ownership is true and parsing is failing 
		Fixed bug in saving (\r and \n are now escaped in attribute values) 
		PUGIXML_NO_EXCEPTION flag for platforms without exception handling 
		Renamed free() to destroy() - some macro conflicts were reported 

21.02.2007 - v0.3 
	Refactored, reworked and improved version. Changes: 

	Interface: 
		Added XPath 
		Added tree modification functions 
		Added no STL compilation mode

		Refactored parsing flags 
		Removed xml_parser class in favor of xml_document 
		Added transfer ownership parsing mode
